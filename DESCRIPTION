Description: Conceptual models are necessary to synthesize what is known
    about a topic, but the process of developing conceptual models based
    on hypotheses in the literature has high potential to be biased or
    incomplete. hypoweavr implements a method to systematically extract
    hypotheses from the literature, merge them into a linked graph, and
    use network analyses to identify links between previously disconnected
    concepts, explore trends in thinking about a topic over time, or 
    identify important hypotheses.
