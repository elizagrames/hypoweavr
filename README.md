# redyarn: an R package for graphical synthesis and analysis of linked hypotheses

<img src="../inst/images/redyarn-logo.png" alt="redyarn hex logo" align="right" style="height: 200px; width:auto;"/> redyarn is an R package that takes hypotheses from different studies and synthesizes them through a graphical analysis. Why is it called redyarn? Because it essentially does the same thing that conspiracy theorists do in television shows: take lots of seemingly disconnected ideas and string them together (with pieces of red yarn) to reach an epiphany.

To install redyarn, use remotes::install_github("elizagrames/redyarn"). If you don't already have the remotes package installed, it can be installed from CRAN with install.packages("remotes"). 

redyarn is a work in progress. Please send any comments, suggestions, or better-designed logos to Eliza Grames at egrames@unr.edu.
